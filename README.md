Our project aims to answer the following question: **How do song statistics and other musical elements correlate to the number of Spotify streams?**

The dataset, from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023/data), documents the most streamed Spotify songs globally of 2023 obtained using the Spotify API and provides an abundance of information about both the song’s background and musicality. A stream is defined as a user listening to a song for more than 30 seconds. The dataset also provides percentage values from a range of 0 - 100 % of danceability, defined as a track’s suitability for dancing based on musical factors such as tempo, beat strength, rhythmic stability, and overall regularity.
